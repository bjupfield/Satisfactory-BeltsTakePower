"Curiously enough, &DerivedClass::some_member_func is a member function pointer of class SomeClass. It is not a member of DerivedClass! (Some compilers behave slightly differently: e.g., for Digital Mars C++, &DerivedClass::some_member_func is undefined in this case.) But, if DerivedClass overrides some_member_func, the code won't compile, because &DerivedClass::some_member_func has now become a member function pointer of class DerivedClass!"
I think this means that a override of a virtual class from a parent class in a child class cannot be targerted by a delegate/function-pointer
I'm not sure that is true though I'll have to ask the discord

we need to find which function activates the build or destroy belt, whenver its built we need to call our functions to assign new power needs for our factories
